## Overview

AI Resume Analyser is a full-stack application built to help users improve their resumes. It provides detailed recommendations and tips based on uploaded resumes, leveraging the power of AI to analyze and enhance profiles effectively. This tool serves both admins and general users with specific functionalities tailored to their roles.

## Goals and Motivation

The inspiration for this project arose from the need to build resumes that align with industry standards and maximize opportunities. Existing solutions often lacked customization, so I decided to create an AI-powered tool that could offer personalized suggestions, making resume building accessible and efficient for everyone.

This project also gave me the chance to refine my skills in backend, frontend, and AI integration, while tackling challenges such as prompt engineering and database management.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend: Streamlit

The user interface was built using **Streamlit** for a quick and interactive user dashboard. These frameworks enabled a seamless and intuitive user experience.

### Backend: Python

The backend was powered by **Python**, making it lightweight yet powerful.

### Database: MySQL

The data persistence layer used **MySQL** to store resumes, user data, and analytics efficiently. This relational database ensured data consistency and quick retrieval.

### AI Integration: GEMINI Models

Leveraging **Gemini models**, the application provides accurate recommendations. Prompt engineering played a crucial role in obtaining detailed and actionable insights from the AI.

## Features

- Get detailed suggestions to improve sections like skills, work experience, and formatting.
- AI-generated feedback tailored to specific job roles.

### 2. Admin Panel

## Challenges and Solutions

### Writing Effective Prompts
Creating prompts to extract meaningful recommendations from the GPT models was a significant challenge. After multiple iterations and testing, I fine-tuned the prompts to achieve the desired level of accuracy.

### Data Privacy
Handling sensitive data like resumes required strict measures to ensure security. User data is encrypted during upload, and the application complies with data protection standards.

### Streamlining AI and Database Integration
Balancing the AI's processing time with efficient database operations was a technical challenge. I implemented asynchronous tasks and optimized queries for seamless performance.
